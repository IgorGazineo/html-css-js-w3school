          For 60 years, WWF has worked to help people and nature thrive. As the
          world's leading conservation organization, WWF works in nearly 100
          countries. At every level, we collaborate with people around the world

      <div class="q-element">
        <h3>HTML &lt;q&gt; for Short Quotations</h3>
        <p>The HTML &lt;q&gt; tag defines a short quotation.</p>
        <p>Browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation.</p>

        <p>

      <div class="abbr-element">
        <h3>HTML &lt;abbr&gt; for Abbreviations</h3>
        <p>
          The HTML &lt;abbr&gt; tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like
          "HTML", "CSS", "Mr.", "ASAP", "ATM".
        </p>
        <p>
          Marking abbreviations can give useful information to browsers,
          translation systems and search-engines.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Tip:</b> Use the global title attribute to show the description for
          the abbreviation/acronym when you mouse over the element.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> was founded in
          1948.

        </p>
        <p>
          The text in the &lt;address&gt; element usually renders in italic, and
          browsers will always add a line break before and after the
          &lt;address&gt; element.
